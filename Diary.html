        <h1 id="intro">JOURNEY SO FAR </h1>
        <h2 id="days">DAY 1 IN VLE</h2>
        <p>I had planned to come late on first day right from the day I registered for the program because I thought it was going to be like every other Niga meeting that works with African man time.<br> I did this on purpose because I'm usually time concious and I hate waiting unneccessarily, I thought VLE was going to operate using African man time but for the first time in a long time I was very much impressed and served the punishment of standing for out more than 4 hours without complaining</p>

        <h2>DAY 2</h2>
        <p>I came early, can't stand been beaten twice but we were still not allowed to enter the conference room where we were using as at then. Myself and others were made to stand outside for long bacause of our action the previous day before Mr. Bereni addressed us, ( did'nt like the fact that i had to stay out though but i later came to understand it was ment to make us understand how serious the program was) </p>
        <h2>DAY 3</h2>
        <p>I heard them chant 1, 121, 12321..., had to bite my tongue as i could bearly understand what they were saying but it didnt take long for me to catch up </p>
        <h2>6th October-MR AMAS'S BIRTHDAY</h2>
        <p>I'm still trying to forgive myself for forgetting that the satuday before today was Mr. Amas's birthday and he told us before time. The cake is here, I've wished him well in arriars though...</p>

        <h2>16th OCTOBER</h2>
        <p>I left my house very optimistic about what the day will look like only to arrive at the secretariate where i had to climb to the 7th floor. was sweating profusly but still hoping for the better only to be disappointed by our own NEPA, there was no light the whole day so we all had a not very interesting day, some of us left left achieving nothing especially myself because my system is a television.</p>
        <h2>21st OCTOBER</h2>
       <p>Mr. Amaete Umana visted<br> He encoureged and motivated us to be optimistic about what we have come to learn in VLE and in life generally. stay hungry , stay foolish he said as he quoted Steve Jobs. <br> He also talked extensively on the importance of having the right attitude in all we do. One key thing I picked was the saying,<em>it is not how hard you hit but how hard you can be hit and still continue...</em> He dropped his email adress which is amaete@gmail.com </p>
       <h2>25th NOVEMBER</h2>
       <p>Miss Chineye Visited <br> she spoke at length on what she does and how she is positively affecting her world by engaging in ways that help keep her environment safe especially in Ghana where she resides.<br> she promised to come back which she did on the hackaton day. She left us her email adress which is chineyenwa.onu@gamil.com</p>
